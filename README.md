Welcome to your TypeScript learning journey! This project is designed to help beginners learn TypeScript through hands-on examples and exercises.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- VS Code (recommended)

```

## 🎯 Learning Path

### 1. Start with the Basics

Run the main file to see TypeScript in action:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 2. Work Through Lessons

Each lesson covers a specific TypeScript concept:

- **Lesson 1**: Basic types (string, number, boolean, arrays, objects)
- **Lesson 2**: Interfaces and type aliases
- **Lesson 3**: Classes, inheritance, and access modifiers
- **Lesson 4**: Generics and advanced types

Run individual lessons:

```bash
npm run lesson1
npm run lesson2
npm run lesson3
npm run lesson4
```

### 3. Practice with Exercises

Complete the exercises in `src/exercises/exercises.ts` to test your knowledge:

```bash
npm run exercises
```

Check your solutions:

```bash
npm run solutions
```

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm run start` - Run the main TypeScript file
- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run dev` - Run in development mode with auto-reload
- `npm run lesson1` - Run lesson 1 (basic types)
- `npm run lesson2` - Run lesson 2 (interfaces)
- `npm run lesson3` - Run lesson 3 (classes)
- `npm run lesson4` - Run lesson 4 (generics)
- `npm run exercises` - Run practice exercises
- `npm run solutions` - Run exercise solutions

## 📖 Key TypeScript Concepts Covered

1. **Type Annotations**: Adding explicit types to variables and functions
2. **Interfaces**: Defining contracts for object shapes
3. **Classes**: Object-oriented programming with TypeScript
4. **Generics**: Creating reusable, type-safe components
5. **Union Types**: Working with multiple possible types
6. **Optional Properties**: Making object properties optional
7. **Access Modifiers**: Controlling access to class members

## 🎓 Learning Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic types and gradually move to advanced concepts
2. **Practice Regularly**: Complete the exercises to reinforce learning
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code examples to see how TypeScript behaves
4. **Read Error Messages**: TypeScript error messages are very helpful for learning
5. **Use VS Code**: Take advantage of IntelliSense and type checking

## 📝 Next Steps

After completing this project, consider:

- Building a small TypeScript application
- Learning about advanced TypeScript features (decorators, utility types)
- Exploring TypeScript with popular frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
- Reading the official TypeScript documentation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure Node.js is installed
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Check that all TypeScript files are in the `src/` directory
4. Use `npm run build` to check for compilation errors
